Project Tile: Terminal Battle

Project Idea:
* Terminal Battle written in the C programming language is designed to allow the player to utilize their knowledge in a simulated battle in the form of knowing when to charge in to deal damage, fall back and heal, or take risks with luck to gain an edge.
* The player will be put against an opponent and will have options to attack head on, use a magic spell, or use items to restore health.
* The battle will end once either the player or enemy's health points (HP) reaches 0. If you win, you gain experience points and a list of statistics used in the battle.
* This program utilizes several functions with several different variables that travel throughout the entire program and are kept track of.
* In addition, this program also utilizes the rand() statement to determine whether certain outcomes of a function will play, whether it be damage dealt/recieved or if a status condition fails/succeeds.
* Loops and conditionals are also heavily used to prevent the player from inputting an invalid choice, keeping variables in bounds (Enemy's nor player's HP can be negative or player's HP above 750), to know what to do when the player chooses one of the avaliable choices, or when the battle is over.
