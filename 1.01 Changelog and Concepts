* Added a Main Menu for the player to navigate before starting the battle
  -  The player can give the enemy whatever name they want (Except without spaces i couldn't figure that out, maybe a little help on that?)
  -  By pressing 2 they can go to the options menu where they can change their HP, enemy HP, potion Count, and the amount healed from potions (Customizibility/Debuging! :D)
  - Pressing 3 exits the program, more so when i accidentlly run it but it's defintely useful (And it's something to make the main menu less boring)
* Fixed a bug where certain integers would suffer from memory overflow (freezeChance and potionCount specifically, more could be affected, dont know why those two specifically but defining them to equal 0 fixed it)


Concepts:
Magic Spell: Aeroga, a wind based magic spell, chance to confuse the enemy and cause them to deal damage to themselves. Damage and miss chance would be between Blizzaga and Thundaga
Magic Spell: Curaga, heals the player but prevents the use of all magic for (3-5?) turns. (Personally dont want the turn cooldown random but its up in the air)
MP (Magic Points). Prevents the use of magic spam (2 High roll Thundagas rn can currently kill the enemy in 2 turns), would probably need to buff all spells in conjunction to another idea
    -  Can be customized in the options menu for more/less total MP
Thundaga Status Effect: Currently stuck between a paralysis or shocked effect where the enemy will miss attacks more often or their attacks deal less damage overall
Ether (Item): Restores MP allowing for more magic casts and/or special attacks  (Can't decide on a default value)
Attack:
  - Blocking: All attacks have a chance to "block" the incoming attack, allowing you to only take a small percentage of the damage you would've taken (Maybe block 60-100%). Magic spells have no chance to block, giving them risk (This is the part where'd we have to buff them)
  - Light Attack: Low damage, but has a high block rate, would be good for if you're both low on HP (Deals like 75-150)
  - Heavy Attack: Higher Damage, lower block rate, useful for if you want to try to dish out attacks but have low MP (But still feeling risky)
  - Special Attacks: This would have it's own menu and allows special attacks for the cost of MP
      - Lucky Strike: Attack that has a chance to restore HP or MP, or neither! (MP cost probably moderate but MP gained would be greater than MP used)
      - Ars Arcanum: High attack that has a higher block rate than even light attacks, but costs about 80% of your MP)
      - Sonic Blade: This medium damage attack has a unique property where you can use it, deal damage, but instead of the enemy acting afterwards, it's still your turn (It's just so fast, takes maybe 25-50% of your MP)
      - Zantesuken: Damage can be super duper low (Like literally 1-10 damage) but has a (1-3?)% chance to instantly KO the opponent (Probably be easiest to just set their HP to 0 instead of subtraction, MP cost is next to nothing maybe like literally 1)

tl:dr still suffering from KH brain rot, i have no creativity, but names are probably the easiest to change in this program
***REMEMBER we dont need to add ALL these features, Aeroga and Curaga personally i think are the least likely to be added in, maybe if we have extra time to kill
* also please shout out your own ideas too!
