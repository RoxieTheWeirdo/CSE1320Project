Project Tile: Terminal Battle: Endless Mode

Project Idea:
* An exciting new mode of Terminal Battle, where you can fight enemies endlessly. See how far you can go and set a new high score!
* Enemies will come in waves, with boss enemies at regular intervals
* Enemies will get progressively more difficult to defeat, with increase attack power and health
* The player will rack up experience with each victory to spend on upgrades
* This program uses structs, pointers, header files, functions, and rand()
