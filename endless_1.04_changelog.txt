NOTE FROM SUHAS
     First things first, Roxie did an great job creating the functionality of Terminal Battle and exploring different concepts, however there are some shortcomings in the development of Endless Mode.
     For my own convenience I'm working in the "endless" branch in the github. I'll leave any administrative actions (merging and versions stuff) to Alex and Roxie
     
     Here are my goals for the end product of Terminal Battle: Endless Mode
          * Compartmentalize everything into functions for the overall sequencing of the game. This is essential for Endless Mode to be developed smoothly
               (I've added a sequencing diagram to the codebase. It's a .canvas type, which can only be opened with the Obsidian application, so I'll try to find a better way to represent the sequencing)
          * Standardize code between Roxies version and mine (Suhas)
          * Implement the Upgrade Shop
          * Implement tracking variables and file storage

CHANGES
     * Streamlined Roxie's original code for Terminal Battle, organizing everything into functions for easier sequencing
